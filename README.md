J'ai utilis√© le template [Fuse-core de tsjensen](https://github.com/tsjensen/fuse-core).


## License

The *Fuse Core* theme is free to use and modify under the terms of the
[CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

## Ancestry

The visual design for this theme is heavily inspired by [Dashingcode](https://github.com/dashingcode)'s
[front-cover](https://github.com/dashingcode/front-cover). Big thank you, it looks awesome!

However, *Fuse Core* is a complete reimplementation, which makes it very different on the inside.
There are many improvements big and small over front-cover, making *Fuse Core* a kind of "front-cover 2.0" or
"front-cover Plus":

- Complete configuration via *_config.yml*, including order of links or adding of new links.
- Ability to show extra HTML below the links, for any crisp statement that you deem necessary to add.
- Use of Bootstrap for responsive design. This gives us supreme browser compatibility and ease of maintenance,
  because a myriad of problems are already handled by the folks at Bootstrap.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) styling instead of raw CSS
- Up-to-date libraries, especially Font Awesome&nbsp;5.
- Support for [Google Analytics ](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), including tracking of outbound links
  (so you'll know which social media profiles people clicked on), and some legal details such as IP anonymization
  and cookie consent popup (all optional).
- Search engine control via configurable meta tags
- Responsive sticky footer
